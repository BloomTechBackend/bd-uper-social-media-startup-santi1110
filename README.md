# Social Media Startup

Your company is working on the beginnings of a social media platform. Currently, the project is in early stages and a lot of changes will be coming over time.

You have been tasked with testing the ability to create a few fake accounts and write small some functionality for the program to perform early testing of the class structure.

Open the `SocialMediaApp` file.
You will be working on the following four methods: `loadDemoAccounts`, `postMessage`, `printUserNames`, `printStateCounts`.
Each of these methods includes a JavaDoc with the expected results of the method. A main method has been provided which will run the four methods for preliminary testing.


## Starting Code
There are several classes and enums being used for you to peruse:
`Account, AccountDetails, Address, LoginInfo, Message, MonthEnum, StateEnum, TimeStamp`

If you take the time to look through each in depth, you may spend too long on your tasks. Make your own choice as to how thoroughly you will look through each class. 

## Instructions

Finish each of the four methods by following the 'UPER' process.

* First understand what each method does - make sure you can communicate easily what is expected of the method.
* Then, create a plan for each method. Figure out what information you need to gather or come up with a step-by-step alogithm in plain English for what needs to be done.
* Execute the plan.
* Reflect on the process. When reflecting, think about what may have helped you solve the problem with less mental strain, potentially quicker, or questions you may want to pose to the company about the structure of the classes. Remember, this is an early stage project so asking good questions now may help the company from going down a bad path.
